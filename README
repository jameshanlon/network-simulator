Network simulator
=================

This project is a simple cycle-based network simulator which models flit-level
communication. It is intended to simulate arbitrary network topologies and
routing algorithms. The interconnection architecure is based on virtual channel
routers with wormhole flow-control. The design is based on the BookSim simulator
(http://nocs.stanford.edu/cgi-bin/trac.cgi/wiki/Resources/BookSim) and is
written in Java.

Dependencies
------------

 - JGraphT library (http://http://www.jgrapht.org/). The Makefile will add
   lib/jgrapht-jdk1.6.jar to the classpath.

Compilation and running
-----------------------

 $ make
 $ make run
